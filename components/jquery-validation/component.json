  "readme": "[jQuery Validation Plugin](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/) - Form validation made easy\n================================\n\nThe jQuery Validation Plugin provides drop-in validation for your existing forms, while making all kinds of customizations to fit your application really easy.\n\n## [Help the project](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18159)\n\nThis project is looking for help! [You can donate to the ongoing pledgie campaign](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18159)\nand help spread the word. If you've used the plugin, or plan to use, consider a donation - any amount will help.\n\nYou can find the plan for how to spend the money on the [pledgie page](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/18159).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nInclude jQuery and the plugin on a page. Then select a form to validate and call the `validate` method.\n\n```html\n<form>\n\t<input required>\n</form>\n<script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.validation.js\"></script>\n<script>\n$(\"form\").validate();\n</script>\n```\n\nFor more information on how to setup a rules and customizations, [check the documentation](http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation).\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt).\n\nIf you've wrote custom methods that you'd like to contribute to additional-methods.js, create a branch, add the method there and send a pull request for that branch.\n\nIf you've wrote a patch for some bug listed on http://plugins.jquery.com/project/issues/validate, please provide a link to that issue in your commit message.\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jörn Zaefferer\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n",
