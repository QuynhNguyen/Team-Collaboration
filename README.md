##Warning

Please do not download the app/ folder and install it on your server. The index file is highly unoptimize. All css and js need to be compressed into one single file and minified before ready for deploy. Additionally, we have to generate a cache manifest file; as well as images compression before the application is ready to be used. A distribution package is expected to be released on version 0.1.0.
